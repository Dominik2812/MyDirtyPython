# MyDirtyPython

## Why dirty?
...cause it's not clean. The projects that I present here are very ambitious beginner projects that are however not optimized, contain no error handling and do not follow the *pep8* conventions. But I posted them anyway as they have been extremely useful for me, either from the didactic point of view or in terms of solving **real world challenges**; perhaps this applies also to you too. The project **separation of overlapping particles on low contrast images** was even used in my former company for quality management.

### 1. separation of overlapping particles on low contrast images: 
This Code solved a real world problem in my old company; get rapid and precise size distribution of plastic beads. 
Interesting also for people who wonder about "How to diminish the error triggered of overlapping particles and how integrate matplotlib histogramms into image analysis"

### 2. Pearl_Chain methode to detect circular objects in an image: 
My personal naive beginners approach on how to find clearly separated object on a black-white image; the pearlchain mechanism. 
Interesting also for people "who just start to learn Python"

### 3. OOP-CoronaSimulation: 

![Simulation](OOP-CoronaSimulation/Simulation.png?raw=true "Simulation")

A simple realization of infection dynamics. Infection happens via objects (people) that pass other objects (Viruses) to eachother. 
Interesting also for people who wonder about "How to live plot values in a simulation"
